I am a first year Master of Science in Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. My research interests are chiefly Federated Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Edge-Computing, Edge-Accelerator Performance Characterization, Distributed and Stochastic Optimization.

Currently, I work on-campus as a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>.


Previously, I was Project Associate - I at DREAM:Lab, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a> Bangalore, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>, where I worked on performance characterization of Nvidia Jetson edge-accelerators on deep learning workloads, and also on a Federated Learning project.

Prior to that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in/">IIT Dharwad</a>. I worked on Federated Algorithms with Bayesian and Exponential Weighted Average approaches for my B.Tech. Project, as a member of LIaN research group, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com/">B. N. Bharath</a>.
