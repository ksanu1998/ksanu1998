I am a second year master’s student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. My interests are chiefly Statistical Machine Learning, Edge-GPU Performance Characterization, Deep Learning Theory, Stochastic Optimization, Federated Learning, and Embedded Computing. I have been selected for the award of the prestigious <a href="https://www.tata.com/newsroom/backing-the-brightest-jn-tata-endowment-fund">J N Tata Endowment scholarship</a> for the higher education of Indians.

I worked as a Machine Learning Software Intern at <a href="https://www.degirum.ai">DeGirum Corp.</a>, Santa Clara, where I developed an ONNX OCR pipeline with pre and post-processor modules compatible with edge-hardware, and worked on a NumPy-only implementation of some vision-based PyTorch operators. I was a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at USC Viterbi, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>, where I contributed to an open source project on tensor decomposition methods, and worked on a faster C++ implementation of a random forest based anomaly-detection algorithm.

Previously, I was Project Associate - I at DREAM:Lab, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a> Bangalore, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>, where I worked on performance characterization of Nvidia Jetson edge-accelerators on deep learning workloads, and also on a Federated Learning project.

Prior to that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in/">IIT Dharwad</a>. I worked on Federated Algorithms with Bayesian and Exponential Weighted Average approaches for my B.Tech. Project, as a member of LIaN research group, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com/">B. N. Bharath</a>.
